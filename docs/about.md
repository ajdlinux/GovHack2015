# About patentstori.es
patentstori.es is a exploration tool for exploring the complex and interesting history of the patents behind Australian Innovations. It is built one of the most comprehensive IP datasets in the world; IP Australia's Intellectual Property Government Open Dataset [[1]],[[2, p.7](2)].

The patent process is complex and few people appreciate just how involved it can be. Out aims was to tie the timeline of these processes to the greater story and history of a particular patent.

By cross referencing the National Library's Trove database [[3]] for relevant sources and IP Australia's AusPat [[6]] frontend we are making the stories of Australia's inventors and innovations more accessible to the general public.

# Datasets We Use
Our primary source is the extensive IPGOD [[1]] dataset. This is used to identify patent applications and generate a visual timeline of the patents application process and history. This has also been used as part of short statistical [analysis][5].

Further information about a particular patent, including its supporting documentation and extract, are extracted from IP Australia's AusPat frontend [[6]].

The National Library's Trove [[3]] is queried for images, articles and publications relevant to the patent application and provides the opportunity for users to further explore the particular innovation.
